# Rux Package Manager

📦 **Package manager** in Rux is a software tool designed to automate the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing software packages or libraries required for a project. Packages are essentially collections of pre-written code, libraries, and other resources that developers can integrate into their own projects to avoid reinventing common functionalities. Package manager will be developed latter.
