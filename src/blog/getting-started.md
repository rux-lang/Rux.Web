# Getting Started

🎉 Welcome to [rux-lang.dev](/) — my new digital home for creative experiments, technical deep dives, and community-driven ideas!

I’m excited to finally have a space where I can share tutorials, design projects, branding insights, and the occasional playful mascot. Whether you're here for code, stickers, or strategy, I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity.

🚀 This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for updates, behind-the-scenes peeks, and ways to collaborate. Let’s build something fun together.
