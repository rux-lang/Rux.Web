### ✨ Invitation to Collaborate and Subscribe

Hey there, fellow builder 👋

Rux is more than just a programming language — it’s a philosophy of clarity, creativity, and community. Whether you're a compiler nerd, syntax stylist, or just someone who loves clean code, Rux welcomes you.

We’re currently shaping the core syntax, tooling, mascot integrations, and documentation pipelines — and your voice could help guide the next big leap.

**Here’s how you can get involved:**

- 💬 **Join the conversation** on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uvSHjtZSVG) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/rux-lang/rux/discussions).
- 🛠️ **Contribute ideas** — from grammar tweaks to mascot variants, we’re open to playful and technical input alike.
- 🧠 **Discuss architecture** — compiler design, type systems, and extensibility are all on the table.

Whether you want to help shape the syntax, test the tooling, or just vibe with Ruxi the mascot, we’d love to hear from you.
