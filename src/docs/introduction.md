# Introduction

Rux is a modern programming language designed for simplicity and clarity, with a refreshing style that emphasizes ease of learning and expressive syntax. It’s still in early development, with multiple GitHub repositories exploring different projects: compiler, website, docs, blog, package manager, code editor support. The project is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/rux-lang/Rux/blob/main/LICENSE), making it open-source and permissive for experimentation and contribution.
