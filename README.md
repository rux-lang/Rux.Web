Built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .vitepress/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.mts
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ *.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ *.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ content.config.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

VitePress looks for `.md` files in the `src/` and `src/docs/` directories. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/public/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `src/public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                             |
