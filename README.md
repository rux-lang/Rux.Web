# Rux Website

Built with [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev)

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
├── .vitepress/
│   └── config.mts
├── src/
│   ├── docs/
│   │   └── *.md
│   ├── public/
│   │   └── assets
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── *.md
│   └── content.config.ts
└── package.json
```

VitePress looks for `.md` files in the `src/` and `src/docs/` directories. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/public/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `src/public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
